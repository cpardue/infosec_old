TOC

Information Security Overview

Terminology 
 A scotoma is a blind spot in your vision. The spot may be in the center, or it may be around the edges of your vision. Rather than a 
 dark spot in your vision, you may have a spot of flickering light near the center of your vision that may drift around the eye, or 
 create arcs of light.
 Hack Value: Notion among hackers that something is worth doing or is interesting.
 Vulnerability: Existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can lead to an expected event compromising the security 
 of the system.
 Exploit: A breach of IT system security through vulnerabilities.
 Payload: Part of an exploit code that performs the intended malicious action, such as destroyinf, creating backdoors, and hijacking 
 computers.
 Zero-Day Attack: An attack that exploits computer application vulnerabilities before the software developer releases a patch for the 
 vulnerability.
 Daisy Chaining: It involves gaining access to one network and/or computer and then using the same info to gain access to multiple 
 networks and computers that contains desirable info.
 Doxing: Publishing personally identifiable information about an individual collected from publicly available databases and social 
 media.  
 Bot: software app that can be controlled remotely to execute or automate pre-defined tasks

Elements of Information Security  
 Confidentiality==Encryption: Assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. 
  crypto (symmetric): requires a key which unlocks the information within
  crypto (assymetric): requires pairs of keys which together unlocks the data within. (public/private keys)
 Integrity==Hash: Trustworthiness of data or resource in terms of preventing improper and unauthorized changes.  
  hash: a one-way non-reversible function which keeps the integrity of a file.  
 Availability==Clustering/LoadBalancing/RAID: Assurance that systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information 
 are accessible when required by 
 the authorized users.  
  Clustering: Bunching multiples of machines together for redundancy
  LoadBalancing: 
  RAID:
 Authenticity==Signature: Authenticity refers to the characteristics of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality 
 of being genuine.
 Non-Repudiation: Sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message
  Identification: individual holds a valid identity (individual username)
  Authentication: indentity of an individual (password, pin, etc)
  Authorization: controlling the access (read/write/execute)
  Accounting: keep track of user actions on the network (who/what/when/where)
   Data Leakage: unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data
   Data Backups: Mirror, Incremental (chunks), Differential (cumulative)
   Data Recovery: Deleted? Currupted? Recoverable.  
   

Information Security Threats and Attack Vectors
 Cloud computing: is an on-demand delivery of IT capabilities, and stores data. Must be secure
 Advanced Persistent Threats: APT focus on stealing info from victim machine w/o user aware
 Viruses and Worms: Capable of infecting a network within seconds
 Mobile Threats: Many attackers see mobile phone as a way to gain access
 Botnet: huge network of compromised systems 
 Insider Attack: an attack performed on a corporate network by an entrusted person w/ access

Hacker Types
 Black hats==Offense: individuals with EXTRAORDINARY COMPUTING SKILLS, resorting to malicious or destructive activities, aslo known as 
  CRACKERS
 White hats==Defense: Individuals professing hacker skills and using them for defensive purposes
 Gray hats: Individuals who work both offense and defense at various times
 Suicide Hackers: Individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a cause and are not worried about jail terms
 Script Kiddies: Unskilled hackers who compromise systems by running scripts, tools, and software developed by REAL HACKERS
 MISSED 3

Threat categories: Network Threats, Host Threats, App Threats
Types of Attacks: OS Attacks, Mis-Config attacks, App Level Attacks, Shrink Wrap Code Attacks

Hacking Concepts, Types, and Phases
Hacking: Exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security 
 Five Phases of Hacking: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining Access, Maintaining Access, Clearing Tracks
  1. Reconnaissance: Preparation phase when an attacker seeks to gather information. Does not directly interact with the system, and 
   relies on social engineering and public info
  2. Scanning: Identify specific vulnerabilities (in-depth probing). Using Port scanners to detect listening ports (companies should shut 
   down ports that are not required) 
  3. Gaining Access: Using vulnerabilities identified during reconnaissance [DoS, Logic/Time Exploit, reconfiguring/crashing system] 
  4. Maintaining Access: Keeping a low profile, keeping system as a launch pad, etc.
  5. Clearing Tracks: Hiding malicious acts while continuing to have access, avoiding suspicion
  

Ethical Hacking Concepts and Scope
 Ethical Hacking: Using tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities w/ permission
 Scope==ShowScotoma: Ethical hacking is a cruicial component of risk assessment, auditing, counter fraud, and best practices.  It is used 
 to identify risks and highlight the remedial actions.  
 Limitations: Can be useful unless used to better understand their security system, but is up to the organization to place the right 
 guards on the network.  Unless the business first knows what it is that they are looking for and why they are hiring an outside 
 vendor to hack systems in the first place, chances are there is not much to be gained from the experience.  

Information Security Controls
 Information Assurance: Assurance for integrity, availability,confidentiality, and authenticity of info
 Threat Modeling: Risk Assessment approach for analyzing security. 1) Identify Security Objectives 2) Application overview 3) 
  Decompose Application 4) Identify Threats 5) Identify Vulnerabilities 
 Network Security Zoning (High to Low): Internet Zone - Internet DMZ - Production Network Zone - Intranet Zone - Management Network Zone
  Security Policies are the foundation of security infrastructure
 Info security policy defines basic requirements and rules to be implemented in order to protect and secure organizations information 
  systems
 Acceptable-Use Policy: defines acceptable use of company resources
 Remote-Access Policy: Defines who can have remote access, defines access medium and remote access security controls
 Defense-in-Depth: Security strategy in which several protection layers are placed throughout an information system.  It helps to 
  prevent direct attacks against an information system because a break in one layer only leads the attacker to the next layer.  
 
Risk
 Risk is the degree of uncertainty or expectation that an adverse event may cause damage to the system
 Risks are categorized into different levels according to their estimated impact on the system
 A risk matrix is used to scale risk by considerint the probability, likelihood, and consequnce/impact of the risk
  High: immediate measures should be taken/controls imposed to reduce risk to reasonably low levels
  Medium: immediate action not required but should implement quickly
  Low: take preventative steps to mitigate effects of the risk
   Incident Management: a set of defined processes to ientify, analyze, prioritize, resolve security incidents
    vulnerability handling, artifact handling, announcements, alerts
   Incident Handling: triage, report and detection, incident response, analysis
    User Behavioral Analysis(UBA) 

Access Control
 Subject: a particular user or process which wants access to the resource
 Object: the specific resource that the subject wants to access on any hardware device
 Reference Monitor: checks the access control rule for specific restrictions
 Operation: represents the action taken by the subject on the object
  Discretionary Access Control: to protect the information/level of sharing/restricted to users & groups
  Mandatory Access Control: to decide who can access the information/does not permit passof privileges
  Role-Based Access Control: access to systems, files, fields on a one-by-one basis/can simplify assignment of privileges

4 types of security policies
 Promiscuous Policy 
 Permissive Policy
 Prudent Policy 
 Paranoid Policy 
 Acceptable-Use Policy
 Remote-Access Policy
 
Physical Security Controls
 Preventative
 Detective Controls
 Deterrent Controls
 Recvery Controls
 Compensating Controls


Types of Vulnerability Assessments: 
 Active Assessments: touches source
 Passive Assessments: does not touch
 Host-Based assessment: assesses a host system 
 Internal Assessment: assesses internal resources
 External Assessment: assesses external side network
 Application Assessments
 Network Assessments
 Wireless Network Assessments

Methodology of Assessment:

Overview of Scanning Pen Testing

Overview of Network Scanning
 Network scanning refers to a set of procedures for identifying hosts, ports, and services in a network
 Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and attacker uses to create a profile of the target organization
 Types of scanning
 Port scanning (list the open ports and services)
 Network Scanning (lists IP addresses)
 Vulnerability Scanning (shows presence of known weaknesses)
   TCP communication Flags (controls transmission of data)
     URG(urgent): Data contained in packet should be processed immediately
     PSH(push): Sends all buffered data immediately 
     FIN(Finish): There will be no more transmissions  
     ACK(Acknowledgement): Acknowledges receipts of a packet
     RST(Reset): Resets a connection
     SYN(Synchronization): Initiates a connection between hosts 



CEH Scanning Methodology 

Check for live systems
 ICMP Scanning: Ping scans involves ICMP ECHO requests to a host. If the host is live, it will return an ICMP ECHO reply
 Useful for locating active devices and if ICMP is passing through firewall
 Ping sweep is used to determine the live hosts from a range of IP addresses 
  nmap 192.168.0-50
  nmap 192.168.0.1-254
  nmap <ip> -p 1-65535
  nmap -sS half open
  nmap -sX xmas scan FUP(FinUrgPsh)
  nmap -sF fin scan
  nmap -T0-5 urgency rating, 4==default, 5==insane
  nmap -F fin?
  nmap -oX output to xml
  nmap -O os
  nmap -sV 
  nmap -sU udp (icmp error comes back if port closed)
  nmap -sI idle scan
  nmap -sT tcp connect (most reliable)
 Attackers calculate subnet masks using Subnet Mask Calculators
 Attackers then use the Ping Sweep to create an inventory of live systems in the subnet
Check for Open Ports
 Simple Service Discovery protocol (SSDP) works in conjunction with UPnP to detect plug and play devices on a networks
 Vulnerabilities in UPnP may allow attackers to launch Buffer overflow or DoS attacks
 Scanning IPv6 networks are computationally less feasible due to larger search space (128 bits)
 Network admins can use Nmap for network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime
 Attacker uses Nmap to extract info such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems 
 and OS versions
 Hping2/Hping3: command line network scanning and packet crafting tools for the TCP/IP protocol 
  hping3 -1 icmp ping
  hping3 -a <ip> spoof an ip address (YOU WILL NEVER GET INTERACTIVE SESSION WITH SPOOFED IP)
  hping3 -FUP xmas scan (FinUrgPsh)
  hping3 -s --flood --rand-src syn flood
  spoofed ip==odd TTL values
 It can be used for network security auditing , firewall testing 
 TCP connect scan detects when a port is open by completing the three-way handshake 
 TCP connect scan establishes a full connection and tears it down sending a RST packet
 It does not require superuser privileges
 Attackers send TCP probe packets with a TCP flags (FIN,URG,PSH) set or with no flags. No responses means port is open, RST means the 
 port is closed
 In Xmas scan, attackers send a TCP frame to a remote device with FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set
 Won’t work against any current version of Microsoft Windows
 Attackers can an ACK probe packet with random sequence number, no responses means the port is filtered (stateful firewall is present) 
 and RST response means the port is not filtered
 A port is considered open if an application is listening on the port
 Most web servers are on port 80 and mail servers on 25
 One way to determine whether a port is open is to send a “SYN” (session establishment) packet to the port
 The target machine will then send back a SYN|ACK packet is the port is open, and a RST (reset) packet if the port is closed
IDLE Scan
 Attack a zombie computer. A zombie machine is one that assigns IPID packets incrementally. 
 Can retrieve IPID number for IP address spoofing
 UDP Scanning: When UDP port is open ---There is not three-way TCP handshake for UDP scan. System does not respond with a me. The 
 system does not respond with a message when the port is open. When UDP port is closed -- the system responds with ICMP port 
 unreachable message. Spywares, Trojan Horses, and other apps use UDP ports
 There are port scanners for mobile as well
Port scanning counter measures 
 Configure firewall, IDS rules to detect/block probes
 Run port scanning tools against hosts to determine firewall properly detects port scanning activity
 Ensure mechanism used for routing and filtering at the routers and firewalls respectively cannot be bypassed
 Ensure sure the router, IDS, and firewall firmware are updated
 Use custom rule set to lock down the network and block unwanted ports
 Filter all ICMP message at the firewalls and routers
Perform TCP and UDP scanning 
 Ensure that anti scanning and anti spoofing rules are configured
Scanning Beyond IDS
 Evasion techniques: fragmented IP packets, spoofing IP address, source routing, connect to proxy servers 
 Lower the frequency of packets, split into parts
Banner Grabbing
 An attacker uses banner grabbing techniques to identify network hosts running versions of applications and OSs with known exploits. 
 Banner grabbing or OS fingerprinting is the method to determine the operating system running on a remote target system. There are two 
 types
 Active Banner Grabbing: specifically crafted packets are sent to remote OS and responses are noted, then compared with a database to 
 determine OS. 
  telnet <ip>:80
  >head /1.0
 Passive Banner Grabbing: Sniffing the network traffic. Banner grabbing from error message, and banner grabbing from page extensions 
 (stealthy)
 Identifying OS’s allow an attack to figure out the vulnerabilities running on a remote target system
 An attacker uses banner grabbing to identify the OS used on the target host and thus determine the system vulnerabilities
 Tools like Netcat reads and writes data across network connections
 
Countermeasures for banner grabbing
 Display False Banners
 Turn off unnecessary services
 Use ServerMask
 Hiding file extensions from web pages
 
Scan for Vulnerability
 Vulnerability scanning identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses of a system
 Nessus is the vulnerability and configuration assessment product
Draw Network Diagrams
 A network diagrams helps in analyzing complete network topology. 
 Drawing target’s network diagram shows logical or physical path to a potential target. Shows network and its architecture to attacker
Prepare Proxies
 Proxy servers serves as an intermediary for connecting with other computers
 Hides the source IP 
Chain multiple proxies to avoid detection
 Many hackers use proxies to hide his/her identity so they cannot be traced. Logs record proxy’s address rather than the attacker’s
 Burp suite includes an intercepting proxy, which lets you inspect and modify traffic between your browser and target app. Popular.
 Anonymizers removes all identifying information from a user’s computer while user surfs internet
 Tails is a live operating system, that user can start on any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card
 Can use HPING2 to IPSpoof
 
IP spoofing counter measures
 Encrypt all network traffic
 Use multiple firewalls
 Do not rely on IP-based authentication
 Use random initial sequence number
 Ingress filtering: use routers and firewalls at network perimeter to filter incoming packets that appear to come from an internal IP 
 address
 Egress filtering: Filter all outgoing packets with an invalid local IP address as source address
 
Scanning Pen Testing
 Pen testing a network determines the network's security posture by identifying live systems, discovering open ports, associating 
 services and grabbing system banners to simulate a network hacking attempt
 
Here’s how to conduct a pen-test of a target network
 Host Discovery: detect live hosts on the target network. It is difficult to detect live hosts behind a firewall (Nmap, 
 Angry IP scanner, colasoft)
 Port Scanning: Check for open ports (Nmap, Netscan)
 Banner Grabbing or OS fingerprinting: determine the OS running on the target host
 Scan the network for vulnerabilities (nessus)
 Draw Network Diagrams that help you understand the logical connection 
 Prepare Proxies: Hides yourself from detection
 Document all findings

Overview of enumeration pen testing


Enumeration Concepts
 In the enumeration phase, attacker creates active connections to system and performs directed queries to gain more information. 
 Uses this information to identify system attack points and perform password attacks
 Conducted in an intRAnet environment

Techniques for Enumeration
 Extract user names using email IDs 
 Extract user names using SNMP
 Extract user groups from windows
 Extract information using the default passwords
 Brute force active directions
 Extract information using DNS Zone Transfer

NetBIOS Enumeration (137,138,139)
 NetBIOS name is a unique 16 ASCII string used to identify the network devices  (15 of it are device name, 16 is reserved for service 
 or name record type)
 Nbtstat utility displays NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocol statistics, NetBIOS name tables/cache
  nbtstat -c
  nbtstat -a
 Net View utility is used to obtain a list of all the shared resources of remote hosts or workgroup
  net view \\<computername>
  net view /workgroups:domain
 can use hyena, netscanpro, superscan, netbios enumerator(sourceforge), pstools

SNMP Enumeration (simple network Management protocol enumeration)
 SNMP enumeration is a process of enumerating user accounts and devices on a target system using SNMP 
 SNMP contains a manager and agent. Agends are embedded on every network, manager installed on a seperate computer 
 SNMP has two passwords
 Attacker uses default community strings to extract info 
 Uses it to extract information about network resources such as hosts, routers, devices, shares
 Management Information Base (MIB)
 MIB is a virtual database containing formal description of all the network objects managed using SNMP
  snmp enumerator for kali
   kali# ./snmpcheck -t <ip>
  look@lan for windows
  
LDAP Enumeration
 hierarchical structure, kangs pyramids, can access AD via LDAP and view group perms
 LDAP is an internet protocol for accessing distributed directory services
 Attacker queries LDAP service to gather information such as valid user names, addresses, departmental details, etc
 Attacker then calls help desk and tricks them into gaining a temp password for login with valid enumerated username

NTP Enumeration
 Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize clocks of networked computers
 Uses UDP port 123 
 Can use it to find important information on a network
 query ntp server to list all conencted hosts
 enumerate with Nmap, Wireshark, and others

SMTP and DNS Enumeration
 SMTP has 3 built-in commands
  VRFY - Validates users
  EXPN - Tells actual delivery addresses of aliasses and mailing lists
  RCPT TO - Defines the recipients of the message
 SMTP servers respond differently to these commands 
 attackers can relay mail from your SMTP server to freely send smap mail to others
 Attackers can directly interact with SMTP via the telnet prompt and collect a list of valid users on the SMTP Server
 enumerate with netscantools, smtp-user-enumarater
 ZONE T R A N S F E R
  c:\nslookup
   >set type=any
   >ls -d domain.com
  #dig domain.com axfr

NULL session
 ports 139 and 445
 net use \\ip\ipc$ "" /user:""

Enumeration Countermeasures

SNMP countermeasures
 Remove SNMP agent on turn off the SNMP service (block 161)
 Change default community string name
 Upgrade to SNMP3, which encrypts passwords/messages
 Implement additional security option called “additional restrictions for anonymous connections”
 Ensure that the access to null session pipes, null session shares, and IPsec filtering are restricted
DNS countermeasures
 Disable DNS zone transfers to the untrusted hosts
 Make sure private hosts and their IP addresses are not published into DNS zone files of public DNS server
 Use premium DNS registration services to hide sensitive information
 Use standard network admin contacts for dns registrations in order to avoid social engineering attacks
SMTP countermeasures
 Ignore email messages to unknown recipients
 Disable open relay features
 Do not include sensitive mail server and local host information in mail responses 
 Limit number of accepted connections to prevent brute force
LDAP countermeasures
 Restrict access to active directory by using software such as citrix 
 Enable account lockout 
 Use SSL technology for LDAP traffic
 force tls with SMTP (starttls option)
 enable account lockouts
NULL session countermeasures
 use netbios
 use smb signing
 disable smb on web/dns servers
 disable 139 & 445
 RestrictNullSessionAccess
 
Enumeration Pen Testing
 Used to identify valid user accounts or poorly protected resource shares
 Information can be users and groups, network resources 
 Used in combination with data collected in reconnaissance phase
 Steps in Enumeration Pen Testing
 Find the network range
 Calculate the subnet mask
 Undergo host discovery
 Perform port scanning 
 Perform NetBIOS enumeration
 Perform SNMP enumeration
 Perform LDAP enumeration
 Perform NTP enumeration
 Perform SMTP enumeration
 Perform DNS enumeration
 Document all findings

Remember OneSixtyOne application, used for scanning SNMP port 161

Overview of system hacking penetration testing 

System hacking is one of the most important and sometimes ultimate goal of an attacker.

Information at hand before system hacking stage
Footprinting: IP range, Namespace, Employees
Scanning module: target assessment, identified systems, identified services
Enumeration: Intrusive probing, user lists, security flaws

System Hacking Goals: 
Gaining Access - password cracking, social engineering
Escalating Privileges (get other passwords) - exploiting known system vulnerabilities
Executing Applications (backdoors) - Trojans, Spywares, Backdoors, Keyloggers
Hiding Files - Rootkits, Steganography
Covering Tracks - Clearing logs


Cracking Passwords

Password cracking techniques are used to recover passwords from computer systems
Attackers use password cracking techniques to gain unauthorized access
Most cracks are successful due to guessable passwords
Types of password attacks 
Non-electronic attacks: Attacker does not need technical knowledge to crack password (looking at keyboard/screen, convincing people, trash bins etc)
Active Online Attacks: Attacker performs cracking by directly communicating with the victim machine (dictionary, brute force, rule based - some info known)
Passive Online Attacks: Performs cracking without communicating with party
Offline Attack: attacker copies password file and tried to crack it 
Default passwords are set by the manufacturer
Trojans can collect usernames and passwords and send to attacker, run in background
Can use USB drive for a physical approach
Hash Injection Attack: attacker injects compromised hash into local session then use it to validate network resource. Finds and extracts a logged on domain admin account hash
Passive Online Attack: Wire Sniffing 
Packet Sniffer tools on LAN 
Capture data may include sensitive information such as passwords
Sniffed credentials are used to gain unauthorized access
Rainbow table attack 
Precomputed table which contains word lists like dictionary files, brute force lists, and their hash values 
Compare the hashes 
Easy to recover passwords by comparing captured password hashes to precomputed tables
Offline Attack: Distributed Network Attack (DNA)
A DNA technique is used for recovering passwords from hashes or password protected files using the unused processing power of machines across the network to decrypt passwords
Microsoft Authentication
Windows stores passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) Database, or in the Active Directory database in domains. They are hashed.
NTLM Authentication
NTLM authentication protocol types 
LM authentication protocol
These protocols stores user’s password in the SAM database using different hashing methods 
Kerberos Authentication
Microsoft has upgraded its default authentication protocol
Password Salting
Random strings of characters are added to the password before calculating their hases
Advantage: salting makes it more difficult to reverse hashes 
Use password crackers like L0phtCrack, Cain&Abel, RainbowCrack
Enable SYSKEY with strong password to encrypt and protect the SAM database

Escalating Privileges

An attacker can gain access to the network using a non-admin user account, next step is to gain admin privileges 
Privilege Escalation Using DLL Hijacking
If attackers place a malicious DLL in the application directory, it will be executed in place of the real DLL
Resetting passwords using command prompt
An admin can reset passwords while an administrator
Countermeasures: restrict interactive login privileges, use least privilege policy, implement multi-factor, run services as unprivileged accounts, patch systems regularly, use encryption technique, reduce amount of code, perform debugging

Executing Applications

Attackers execute malicious programs remotely in the victim's machine to gather information
Backdoors
Crackers
Keyloggers
Spyware
Software like RemoteExec can remotely install software, execute programs/scripts
There are hardware and software keystroke loggers (USB vs App)
Spyware
Records user’s interaction
Hides its process
Hidden component of freeware program
Gather info about victim or organization
GPS spyware also exists
Countermeasures for Keyloggers
Pop-up blocker
anti-spyware/virus
Firewall software
Anti-keylogging software
Recognize phishing emails and delete
Choose new passwords for different online accounts
Avoid opening junk emails
There are Anti-keyloggers out there
Rootkits are programs that hide their presence and an attacker's malicious activities, granting them full access to the server or host at the time or in future
Typical Rootkit has backdoor programs, DDos  programs, packet sniffers, log-wiping utilities, IRC bots, etc
6 Types of Rootkits
Hypervisor Level Rootkit: Acts as hypervisor and modifies boot sequence of the computer to load the host OS as a virtual machine. 
Boot Loader level rootkit: replaces original boot loader with one controlled by attacker
Hardware/Firmware Rootkit: Hides in hardware devices or platform firmware which is not inspected for code integrity
Application level rootkit: replaces regular application binaries with fake trojan, or modifies the behavior of existing applications
Kernel Level Rootkit: Adds malicious code or replaces original OS kernel and device driver codes
Library Level Rootkits: Replaces original system calls with fake ones to hide information about attacker
Detecting Rootkits
Integrity-Based detection: compares a snapshot of the filesystem,boot records, or memory
Signature-based technology: compares characteristics of all system processes and executable files with a database of known rootkit fingerprints
Heuristic/Behavior based detection: any deviations in the systems normal activity
Runtime Execution path profiling: compares runtime execution paths of all system processes before and after rootkit infection
Cross View-Based detection: enumerates key elements in the computer system such as system files, processes, and registry keys and compares them to an algorithm to generate a similar data set that does not rely on common APIs
NTFS Data Stream
NTFS alternate data stream (ADS) is a windows hidden stream which contains metadata for the file such as attributes, word count, author name, access and modification time of files
Using NTFS stream, an attacker can almost completely hide files within the system.
You can hide a file side another file (trojan in a readme.txt)
Countermeasures: use a third party file integrity checker
Steganography
Steganography is a technique of hiding a secret message within an ordinary message and extracting it at the destination
Utilizing a graphic image as a cover is the most popular method to conceal the data in files 
Attackers can use steganography to hide messages such as list of compromised servers, source code for the hacking tools, plans for future attacks, etc
Technical Steganography: invisible ink/microdots, physical methods to hide
Linguistic Steganography: Type that hides the message in another file
Semagrams: use of symbols to hide information
Least Significant bit insertion: The rightmost bit of a pixel is called the LSB
Masking and Filtering: Making technique hides data similar to watermarks on actual paper. Can be detection with simple statistical analysis. Mostly in grayscale images.
Algorithms and Transformation
Hide data in mathematical functions used in compression algorithms
Data is embedded by changing the coefficients of a transform of an image
Audio steganography - information in hidden frequency
Steganalysis
Art of discovering and rendering covert messages using steganography. It attacks steganography efforts



Covering Tracks

Techniques used for covering tracks 
Disable Auditing: disabling audit features of target system
Clearing logs: attacker clears/delete the system log entries for their activities
Manipulating logs: Manipulates logs in a way they won't be caught in legal actions 
If system is exploited with metasploit, attacker uses meterpreter shell to wipe logs

Module 6: Malware Threats
TOC

Module Objectives
Introduction to Malware and Malware propagation techniques 
Overview of Trojans, their types, how to to infect systems
Overview of Viruses, their types, and how they infect files
Introduction to the Computer Worm
Understanding the Malware Analysis process
Understanding Different techniques to detect malware
Malware countermeasures
Overview of Malware penetration testing


Introduction to Malware

Malware is a malicious software that damages or disables computer systems and give limited control or full control of the systems to the attacker for the purpose of theft or fraud
Examples of Malware: Trojan Horse, Backdoor, Rootkit, Ransomware, Adware, Virus, Worms, Spyware, Botnet, Crypter
Common techniques attackers use to distribute malware: Blackhat SEO, Social Engineer Clickjacking, Spear Phishing sites, Malvertising, Compromised legitimate websites, Drive by downloads on browser vulnerabilities 


Trojan Concepts

A trojan is a program which the malicious or harmful code is contained inside an apparently harmless program or in such a way it can get control and cause damage, such as ruining a file allocation table on your hard disk
Trojans get activated upon user’s certain predefined actions, and conduct abnormal activities on the system
When a trojan is installed, they attacker can basically do anything to your computer




How to infect systems using a trojan
Create a new trojan packet using a trojan horse construction kit 
Create a dropper, which is part in a trojanized packet that installs the malicious code on the target system
A wrapper binds a trojan executable with an innocent looking .EXE application such as games or office applications. When an EXE is executed, it first installs the trojan in the background.

Attackers use crypters to hide viruses, spyware, keyloggers to make them undetectable by antivirus
Attackers can deploy a trojan by creating a malicious link/email attachments
Exploit kit: Platform to deliver exploits and payloads such as trojans, backdoors, bots, buffer overflow scripts,etc
Evading Anti-Virus Techniques: 
Break the trojan file into multiple pieces and zip them as a single file
ALWAYS write your own Trojan, and embed it into an application
Change the Trojans Syntax
Convert EXE to VB script
Change the content of the Trojan using Hex Editor and also change the checksum and encrypt the file 
Never use trojans downloaded from the web (antivirus can detect these easily)


Command shell trojans give remote control of a command shell
Trojan server is installed on the victim’s machine, which opens a port for attacker to connect. 
Defacement Trojans: Can destroy or change entire content present in a database. Much more dangerous when attackers target websites 
Botnet Trojans: infect a large number of computers to create a network of bots(chewbacca)
Proxy Server Trojans: Converts user’s computer into proxy servers, thus making them accessible to specific attackers.
VNC Trojan: VNC trojan starts a VNC server daemon in the infected systems. Attacker can connect to the victim using any VNC viewer 
HTTP/HTTPS Trojans: bypass firewall, spawn a child program and child program appears to be a user to the firewall
ICMP Tunneling 
Covert channels are methods in which an attacker can hide the data in a protocol that is undetectable
They rely on techniques called tunneling, which allow on protocol be carried over to another protocol . very stealthy
Remote Access Trojans: provide attackers with full control over the victim’s system
E Banking Trojans - intercept a victim’s account information before it is encrypted 
Steals victim’s data such as credit card information
Notification Trojans: Sends the location of the victim’s IP address to attacker
Whenever victim’s computer connected to the internet, the attacker receives the notification

Viruses and Worm Concepts 

Virus: A self replicating program that produces its own copy by attacking itself to another program, computer boot sector or document
Transmitted through downloads, infected flash drives, email attachments
Stages of Virus Life
Design: creating the virus
Replication: Replicating the virus on target system
Launch: launching/running the virus (.exe file)
Detection: Target system identifies virus
Incorporation : Anti-virus softwares update
Elimination: users install anti-virus update to eliminate virus 
Indications of a virus attack: abnormal activities (slow, anti virus alerts, folders missing, etc)
There are many Fake Anti-Viruses that are actually viruses
Ransomware restrict computer files until a sum is paid 
Boot Sector Viruses: moves MBR to another location on hard disk 
File Virus: Infects files which are executed or interpreted on the system such as (COM, EXE, SYL, OVL, OBJ, MNU and BAT files
Multipartite Virus: Infect the system boot sector and the executable files at the same time (hybrid, top 2 combined))
Macro Viruses: Infect files created by Microsoft Word or Excel. Most of these are written in macro language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
Infect Templates, convert infected documents into template files 
Cluster Viruses: These modify directory table contents so that it points users to system processes to the virus code isntead of the actual program 
There is only one copy of the virus on the disk infecting all the programs in the computer system
Will launch itself first when any program on the computer system is started 
Stealth/Tunneling Virus: This virus evades anti-virus software by intercepting its requests to the operating system
Virus can return an uninfected version of the file to the anti-virus software, so it appears as if the file is “clean”
Encryption Viruses: uses simple encryption to encipher the code. Virus is encrypted with different key for each infected file. AV Scanner cannot directly detect these types fo viruses using signature detection methods 
Polymorphic Code: Code that mutates while keeping the original algorithm intact. Well written polymorphic code has no parts that stay the same on each infection
Metamorphic Viruses: Rewrite themselves completely each they are to infect new executable
Can Reprogram itself by translating its own code into a temporary representation and then back to the normal code again
File Overwriting or Cavity Virus: Overwrites a part of the host file that is constant (usually nulls), without increasing the length of the file and preserving its functionality 
Sparse Infector Viruses: Infects only occasionally, or only files whose length falls within a narrow range. By infection less often, they try to minimize the probability of being discovered 
Companion/camouflage Viruses: Creates a companion file for each executable file the viruses infects. Therefor, a companion virus may save itself as notepad.com and every time the user executes notepad.exe (good program), the computer will load the virus notepad.com and infect 
Shell Viruses: Virus code forms a shell around the target host program’s code, making itself the original program and host code as its sub-routine. Almost all boot program are shell viruses 
File Extension Viruses: changes the extensions of files.  Ex. .TXT is a safe file. Virus file is BAD.TXT.VBS but will only show up as bad.txt . When opened a script executes.
Add-on Virus: adds on their code to the host code without making any changes to the latter or relocate the host code to insert their own code at the beginning 
Intrusive Viruses: Overwrite the host code partly or completely with the viral code
Transient/Direct Action Virus: Transfers all the controls of the host code to where it resides in the memory. Virus runs when the host code is run and terminates itself or exits memory as soon as host code execution ends
Terminate and Stay Resident Virus: remains permanently in the memory during entire work session even after the host’s program is executed and terminated. Removed only by rebooting system.
Computer Worms: Malicious programs that replicate, execute, and spread across network connections independently without human interaction. Most are created only to replicate and spread, but some have payloads 
Attackers use payloads to install backdoors which turns them into a zombie for a botnet
A worm is a special type of malware that can replicate itself and use memory, but cannot attach itself to other programs 
A worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on a computer and spreads through the infected network

Malware Reverse Engineering

Sheep Dipping refers to the analysis of suspect files, incoming messages, for malware
A sheep dip computer is installed with port monitors, file monitors, network monitors and antivirus software and connects to a network only under strictly controlled conditions
Anti-Virus Sensor Systems: Collection of computer software that detects and analyzes malicious code threats
Malware Analysis Procedure: 
Perform static analysis when the malware is inactive 
Collect info of string values found in binary with tools 
Setup network connection and check there are no errors
Run the virus and monitor the process actions and system information with help of process monitor/explorer
Record network traffic information using monitoring tools (TCP view, netResident)
Determine the files added, processes spawn, and changes to registry with tools 
Collect Service requests and DNS tables information, attempts for incoming and outgoing connections using tools 

Malware Detection

Trojans open unused ports in victims machine to connect back to Trojan handlers
Look for connection established to unknown or suspicious IP addresses
You can use a port monitoring tool 
Scanning for Suspicious Processes
Trojans camouflage themselves as genuine Windows services 
Some trojans use Portable Executable to inject into various processes 
Processes are visible but may look like a legitimate processes and helps bypass desktop firewalls
Trojans can also use rootkit methods to hide their processes 
Use process monitoring tools to detect hidden trojans and backdoors
Trojans are installed along with device drivers downloaded from untrusted sources
Scan suspicious drivers and verify they are genuine and downloaded from publishers original site
Trojans normally modify system’s files and folders. Use these tools to detect changes
SIGVERIF: checks integrity of critical files digitally signed by microsoft
FCIV - Computes MD5 or SHA-1 cryptographic hashes for files
TRIPWIRE: system integrity verifier that scan and reports critical system file for changes
Scanning for suspicious network activities
Trojans connect back to handlers and send confidential info to attackers 
Use network scanners

Virus Detection Methods
Anti-virus executes the malicious code to simulate. Effective for dealing with encrypted and polymorphic viruses 
Heuristic Analysis: Can be static or dynamic. In static, anti-virus analyzes the file format and code structure to determine is code is viral. In dynamic, the AV performs a code emulation 

Counter-Measures

Trojan Countermeasures
Avoid opening email attachments from unknown senders
Block unnecessary ports 
Avoid accepting programs transferred by instant messaging
Hard weak default configs and unused functionality including protocols/services
Monitor internal network traffic for odd ports 
Avoid downloading and executing apps from untrusted sources 
Install security updates
Scan CD’s and DVD’s w/ antivirus software
Restrict permissions within desktop environment 
Manage local workstation file integrity 
Run Host-Based Antivirus

Backdoor Countermeasures
Anti-viruses
Educate users not to download from untrusted sites

Anti-Malware Software

Norton, Mcafee, Nessus etc.

Module 7: Sniffing
TOC


Objectives: Overview of sniffing concepts, understanding MAC attacks, Understanding DHCP attacks, understanding ARP poisoning, Understanding MAC spoofing attacks, Understanding DNS poisoning, Sniffing tools, Sniffing countermeasures, Understanding various techniques to detect sniffing, overview of sniffing pen testing 

Sniffing Concepts
Sniffing is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets passing through a given network using sniffing tools (form of wire tap)
Many enterprises switch ports are open 
Anyone in same physical location can plug into network with ethernet
How a sniffer works
Sniffer turns on the NIC of a system to the promiscuous mode that it listens to all the data transmitted on its segment 
Each computer has a MAC address and an IP address 
Passive sniffing means through a hub (involves sending no packets), on a hub traffic is sent to all ports 
Most modern networks use switches
Active Sniffing: Searches for traffic on a switched LAN by actively injecting traffic into the LAN. Involves injecting address resolution packets (ARP) into the network 
Protocols vulnerable to sniffing:
HTTP, Telnet and Rlogin, POP, IMAP, SMTP and NNTP
Sniffers operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model 
Hardware Protocol Analyzer: equipment that captures signals without altering the traffic in a cable segment 
Can be used to monitor traffic. Allows attacker to see individual data bytes
Span Port: A port which is configured to receive a copy of every packet that passing through a switch
Wiretapping: Process of monitoring telephone and internet convo’s by third party
Via connecting a listening device (hardware or software) to the circuit 
Active Wiretapping: Monitors, records, and injects something into the communication or traffic 
Passive Wiretapping:  It only monitors and records the traffic and gain knowledge of the data it contains 
Lawful interception: legally intercepting data communication

MAC Attacks

Each switch has a fixed size dynamic content addressable memory (CAM table)
CAM table stores information such as MAC address available on physical ports 
If CAM table is flooded with more MAC address it can hold, then the switch turns into a HUB
Attackers exploit this 
Switch Port Stealing: uses mac flooding to sniff the packets
How to defend against MAC attacks: use a port security to restrict inbound traffic from only a selected set of mac addresses and limit MAC flooding attacks


DHCP Attacks

DHCP servers maintain TCP/IP configuration information (provides leases)
DHCP starvation attack: attacker broadcasts forged DHCP requests and tries to lease all DHCP addresses available in the DHCP scope
As a result, legitimate user is unable to obtain or renew an IP address
Rogue DHCP: rogue DHCP server in network and responds to DHCP requests with bogus IP addresses 
How to defend against DHCP starvation and Rogue Server Attack: Enable port security for DHCP starvation, and enable DHCP snooping that allows switch to accept DHCP transactions from a trusted port

ARP Poisoning

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a stateless protocol used for resolving IP address to machine (MAC) addresses 
All network devices broadcasts ARP queries in the network to find machine’s MAC address
When one machine needs to communicate with another, it looks up to the ARP table. If it’s not there, the ARP_REQUEST is broadcasted over the network 
ARP packets can be forged 
ARP spoofing involves constructing large number of forged ARP requests 
Switch is set in ‘forwarding mode’ after the ARP table is flooded with spoofed ARP replies 
Attackers flood a target computer’s ARP cache with forged entries, which is also known as poisoning 
ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an ethernet LAN
Using Fake ARP messages, an attacker can divert all communications between two machines so that all traffic is exchanged via his/her PC
ARP Tools: Cain & Abel, WinArpAttacker
How to defend: Implement dynamic ARP inspection, DHCP Snooping, XArp spoofing detection

Spoofing

Attacker can sniff network for MAC addresses, then spoof them to receive all the traffic destined for the user. Allows allows attacker to gain access to the network 
IRDP spoofing: ICMP Router discovery protocol allows host to discover the IP address of active routers. 
Attacker sends spoofed IRDP router advertisement message to the host on the subnet, causing it to change its default router 
How to defend: DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP inspection, IP source guard

DNS Poisoning

DNS poisoning is a technique that tricks a DNS server into believing that it has received authentication when it really has not 
Results in substitution of a false IP address 
Attacker can create fake DNS entries 
Intranet DNS spoofing: must be connected to LAN and able to sniff. Works well against switches with ARP poisoning the router. 
Intranet DNS spoofing attacker infects machine with trojan and changes DNS IP to that of attacker
Proxy Server DNS poisoning: attacker sends a trojan to machine that changes hosts proxy server settings in internet explorer to that of the attacker’s and redirect to fake website 
DNS Cache Poisoning: Refers to altering or adding forged DNS records into DNS resolver cache so that a DNS query is redirected to a malicious site
How to defend: resolve all DNS queries to local DNS server, Block DNS requests from going to external servers, configure firewall to restrict external DNS lookup, Implement IDS and deploy correct, Implement DNSSEC

Sniffing Tools 

Wireshark







Counter-Measures
Restrict physical access
Use encryption 
Permanent add MAC address to the gateway to the ARP cache
Use static IP addresses
Turn off network ID broadcasts
Use IPV6 
Use HTTPS instead of HTTP
Use switch than Hub 
Use SFTP instead of FTP

Sniffing Detection Techniques

Runs IDS and notice if mac address of certain machines have changed
Check which machines are running in the promiscuous mode 
Promiscuous mode allows a network device to intercept and read each network packet
Only a machine in promiscuous mode cache the ARP information 
A machine in promiscuous mode replies to the ping message as it has correct information about the host sending a ping request 

Sniffing Pen Testing 

Sniffing pen test is used to check if the data transmission from an org is secure from sniffing and interception attacks

Module 9: Denial of Service
TOC

Objectives: Overview of DOS attacks and DDoS attacks, understanding the techniques of DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques, Understanding the Botnet Network, Understanding Various DoS and DDoS attack tools, DoS/DDoS countermeasures, Overview of DoS attack penetration testing 

DoS/DDoS Concepts

Denial of Service (DoS) is an attack on a computer or network that reduces, restricts or prevents accessibility of system resource to its legitimate users
Attackers flood a victim system with non-legitimate service requests 
DDoS attack involves a multitude of compromised systems attacking a single targeted system (botnet)

DoS/DDoS Attack Techniques

Basic categories of the attacks
Volumetric Attacks: consumes the bandwidth of the target network or service 
Fragmentation: overwhelms target’s ability of reassembling fragmented packets
TCP state-exhaustion attack: consumes connection state table present such as load balancers ,firewalls, app servers
Application layer attack: consumes app resources or service making it unavailable to other legitimate users 
SYN Attack
Attacker sends a large number of SYN request to target server 
Target machine sends back a SYN ACK in response to the request waiting for the ACK to complete session
Attacker never sends ack 
ICMP flood attack: type of DoS where perpetrators send a large number of ICMP packets causing the system to stop responding to legitimate TCP/IP requests 
To protect yourself: set a threshold limit that invokes a ICMP protection feature
Peer to Peer Attack: attackers instruct clients of p2p file sharing hubs to disconnect for their p2p network and connect to victims fake website. Attackers can launch massive DoS attacks and compromise websites
Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack: Also known as phlashing, refers to attacks that cause irreversible damage to system hardware
Unlike other DoS attacks,, it sabotages the system hardware 
Application-Level Flood Attack: Application-level flood attacks results in the loss of services 
Using this attack , attackers exploit weaknesses in programming source code to prevent in the application from processing legitimate requests
Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)
Also known as a spoofed attack, involves the use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines that contribute to the actual DDoS attack against the target machine or application

Botnets

Bots are software applications that run-automated tasks over the internet 
A botnet is a huge network of compromised systems and can be used by an attacker to launch a DoS attack
Scanning Methods for Finding Vulnerable Machines: Random Scanning, Hit-list scanning, topological scanning, local subnet scanning, permutation scanning 

DoS and DDoS attack tools
LOIC, GoldenEye

Countermeasures

Techniques 
Activity Profiling
Increases in activity levels, distinct clusters, average packet rate etc
Changepoint detection
Filters network traffic by IP addresses, targeted port numbers, stores traffic flow data in a graph that shows the traffic flow rate vs time 
Wavelet-based signal analysis
Analyzes network traffic in terms of spectral components. Divides incoming signal into various frequencies for analyzation
DoS/DDoS countermeasure strategies 
Absorbing the attack (requiring additional resources)
Degrading services (identify critical services and stop non-critical)
Shutting down the services
Deflect Attacks: Honeypots act as an enticement for an attacker. Serve as a means for gaining information about attackers, stores their activities 
Ingress filtering: protects from flooding attacks. Enables originator be traced to its true source
Egress Filtering: scanning packet headers of IP address leaving a network. Ensures unauthorized or malicious traffic never leaves the internal network 
Mitigate Attack: Load balancing, throttling
Post-Attack Forensics 
Analyze traffic patterns for new filtering techniques, analyze router, firewall, and IDS logs , can update load-balancing and throttling countermeasures

Module 10: Session Hijacking
TOC

Module Objectives
Understanding session hijacking concepts
Understanding application level session hijacking
Understanding network level session hijacking 
Session hijacking tools
Session hijacking countermeasures
Overview of session hijacking penetration testing 

Session Hijacking Concepts
What is session hijacking?
Since most authentication occurs at the start of a TCP session, this allows the attacker to gain access to the machine. He can take the cookie and play it as his own
Cookie will however expire after sometime. Much easier to steal cookie than brute force a password/token 
Why is session hijacking successful?
No account lockout for invalid session IDs 
Weak session ID generation algorithm 
Insecure handling of session IDs
Indefinite session expiration time 
Most computers using TCP/IP are vulnerable
Most countermeasures do not work unless you use encryption
Session Hijacking Process
Referer attack: attacker tries to lure a user to click on a link to malicious site 
Get Request [pull the web page]
During Session Hijacking process (syn-ack), attacker must time it to jump into the session
Brute forcing: attacker attempts difference IDs until he succeeds
Sniff>Monitor>Session Desynchronization>Session ID prediction>Command Injection
Types of session hijacking
Active Attack: Attacker finds active session and takes over
Passive Attack: Attack hijacks a session but sits back and watches and records all the traffic that is being sent forth 
Session Hijacking in OSI Model: Network Level Hiking, Application Level Hijackings
Network Level OSI Model: Network level hijacking can be defined as the interception of the packet during transmission between client and server
Application Level Hijacking: App level hijacking is about gaining control over the HTTPs user session by obtaining the session IDs
Spoofing vs Hijacking
Spoofing Attack: pretends to be another user 
Attack pretends to be another user 
Hijacking: process of taking over an existing active session

Application Level Session Hijacking

A session token can be compromised in various ways
Session sniffing 
Sniff to capture valid session token or ID
Predictable session token 
Predict a session ID generated by a weak algorithm
Guesses unique session value or deduce session ID
Man-in-middle attack
Intruding an existing connection and intercept
Attackers use different techniques and split the TCP connection 
Man-in-browser attack
Uses a trojan horse to intercept calls between browser and its security mechanisms
Can be a malicious extension
Cross-site script attack
XSS enables attackers to inject malicious client side scripts into web pages
Malicious Javascript code 
Trojan horse can change proxy settings in user’s browser
Cross-site request forgery attack (CSRF)
A CSRF attack exploits victim’s active session with a trusted site in order to perform malicious activities 
Session replay attack
In session reply, the attacker listens to the conversation between the user and the server and captures the authentication token of the user 
Once authentication token is captured, the attacker replays the request to the server with the authentication token
Session fixation
Session fixation is an attack that allows an attacker to hijack a valid user session
Attack tries to lure a user to authenticate himself with a known session ID and then hijacks the user-validated session
Attacker has to provide a legitimate web app session ID and try to lure the victim browser to use it 

CSRF Cross site request forgery: 
User visits banking site. Attacker has user somehow visit his site. His site infects and adds onto her session and insert more commands into her session and do things she did not authorize. 

Network Level Session Hijacking

The 3-way handshake: if the attacker can anticipate the next sequence and ACK number , they can spoof bobs address and start a communication with the server
TCP/IP Hijacking: 
Blind Hijacking
Attacker injects malicious data or commands into the intercepted communication in the TCP session even if the source-routing is disabled
The attacker can send the data or comments but has no access to see the response
You might be able to see the effects however 
UDP Hijacking
Manipulating the packet

Session Hijacking Tools

ZAP (zed attack proxy by OWASP) is an integrated penetration testing tool 
BURP Suite: inspect and modify traffic. Analyzes all kinds of content. Is an interception proxy

Countermeasures


IPSec: protocol suite for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session
Deployed widely to implement virtual private networks (VPNs) and for remote user access through dial up connection to private networks 
Transport Mode: Authenticates two connected computers. Option to encrypt data    transfer. Compatible with NAT
Tunnel Mode: Encapsulates packets being transferred. Option to encrypt data. Not compatible with NAT.

Module 11: Hacking Webservers
TOC

Objectives: Understanding web server concepts, understanding web server attacks, understanding webserver attack methodology, webserver attack tools, countermeasures against web server attacks, overview of patch management, webserver security tools, overview of web server penetration testing

Web server Concepts

A web server is a program that hosts websites, attackers usually target software vulnerabilities and config errors to compromise the servers
Nowadays, network and OS level attacks can be well defended using proper network security measures such as firewalls, IDS, etc. Web servers are more vulnerable to attack since they are available on the web
Why are web servers compromised
Improper file/directory permissions
Installing the server with default settings
Unnecessary services enabled
Security conflicts 
Lack of proper security policy
Improper Authentication
Default Accounts
Misconfigs
Bugs in OS 
Misconfigured SSL certificates
Use of self-signed certs
IIS (internet information service) is a webserver application developed by Microsoft for Windows.

Webserver Attacks

SQL Injection Concepts
SQL injection is a technique used to take advantage of non-validated input vulnerabilities to pass SQL commands through a web app for execution by the backend database
Usually to retrieve information
This is a flaw in web apps
Attacker can deface a web page with this attack
They can add info to your website, extract data, and insert new data

Types of SQL Injection

Error based SQL Injection: Attacker puts intentional bad input into app to see the database-level error messages. Uses this to create carefully designed SQL Injections
Blind SQL Injection: Attacker has no error messages from the system with which to work. Instead, attack simply sends a malicious SQL query to the database
Whenever you see SELECT, it is probably a SQL command 
Union SQL command, joining a forged query to the original query 
Time-Based SQL Injection: evaluates time delay in response to true-false queries

SQL Injection Methodology

Information gathering and SQL vulnerability detection
Attackers analyze web GET and POST requests to identify all input fields
Afterwards, launch attack
Advanced SQL injections

TOC

Understanding IDS, Firewall, and Honeypot Concept : IDS, Firewall and Honeypot Solutions: Understanding different techniques to bypass IDS : Understanding different techniques to bypass firewalls, IDS/Firewall Evading Tools : Understanding different techniques to detect honeypots : Overview of IDS and Firewall Penetration Testing

IDS, Firewall, and Honeypot Concepts

An IDS inspects all inbound and outbound network traffic for suspicious patterns that may indicate a network security breach 
Checks traffic for signatures that match known intrusion patterns
Anomaly Detection (behavior detection)
Protocol Anomaly Detection
Indications of Intrusions
System Intrusions
Presence of new files/programs
Changes in file permissions
Unexplained changes in file size
Rogue Files
Unfamiliar file names in directories
Missing files
Network Intrusions
Repeated probes of the available services on your machines
Connections from unusual locations
Repeated login attempts from remote hosts
Arbitrary data in log files
Firewall Architecture 
Bastion Host
Computer system designed and configured to protect network resources from attack
Screened Subnet
Also known as the DMZ contains hosts that offer public services. DMZ zone only responds to public requests, and has no hosts accessed by the private network
Multi-homed Firewall
A firewall with two or more interfaces
DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)
A network that serves as a buffer between the internal secure network and insecure internet 
Can be created using firewall with three or more main network interfaces
Types of Firewall
Packet Filters: works on the network layers of OSI. Can drop packets if needed
Circuit Level Gateways: Works at the sessions layer. Information passed to a remote computer through a circuit-level gateway appear to have originated from the gateway. They monitor requests to create sessions, and determines if the session will be allowed. They allow or prevent data streams    
Application Level Gateways: App-level proxies can filter packets at the application later of the OSI
Stateful Multilayer Inspection Firewalls: combines the aspects of the other three types of firewalls
Honeypot
Information system resource that is expressly set up to attract and trap people who attempt to penetrate an organization's network 
Honeypot can log port access attempts, monitor attacker’s keystrokes, show early signs etc
2 Types of Honeypots
Low-interaction Honeypots: simulate only a limited number of services and apps. Cannot be compromised
High-interaction Honeypots: simulates all services and apps. Can be completely compromised by attackers.
Captures complete information about an attack vector such attack techniques

IDS Tools

Snort

Evading IDS
 
Insertion Attack: IDS blindly believes and accepts the packet
Evasion: End system accepts a packet that an IDS rejects. Attacker is exploiting the host computer
DoS Attack: Attackers intrusion attempts will not be logged
Obfuscating: encoding the attack payload in a way that the target computer understands but the IDS will not (polymorphic code, etc)
False Positive Generation: Attackers w/ knowledge of the target IDS, craft packets just to generate alerts. Causes IDS to generate large number of false positive alerts. Then use it to hide real attack traffic
Session Splicing
Unicode Evasion Technique: Attackers can convert attack strings to unicode characters to avoid pattern and signature matching at the IDS
Fragmentation Attack: Attackers will keep sending fragments with 15 second delays until all attack payload is reassembled at the target system
TTL attacks require attacker to have a prior knowledge of the topology of the victim's network
Invalid RST Packets
Uses a checksum to communicate with host even though the IDS thinks that communication has ended
Urgency Flag
A URG flag in the TCP header is used to mark the data that requires urgent processing 
Many IDS do not address the URG pointer
Polymorphic Shellcode: Most IDSs contains signatures for commonly used strings within shellcode. This can be bypassed by using encoded shellcode containing a stub that decodes the shell code
App Layer Attacks: IDS cannot verify signature of a compressed file

Evading Firewalls

Port Scanning is used to identify open ports and services running on these ports 
Open ports can be further probed to identify the version of services, which helps in finding vulnerabilities in these services
Firewalking: A technique that uses TTL values to determine gateway ACL filters 
Attacker sends a TCP or UDP packet to the targeted firewall with a TTL set to one hop greater
Banner Grabbing: Banners are service announcements provided by services in response to connection requests, and often carry vendor version information
IP address spoofing to a trusted machine
Source Routing: Allows sender of a packet to partially or completely specify the route of a packet through a network, going around a firewall
Tiny Fragments: Forcing some of the TCP packet’s header info into the next fragment
ICMP Tunneling: Allows tunneling a backdoor shell in the data portion of ICMP echo packets
Ack Tunneling: Allows tunneling a backdoor application with TCP packets with the ACK bit set
HTTP Tunneling Method: allows attackers to perform various internet tasks despite restrictions imposed by firewalls. Method can be implemented if the target company has a public web server with port 80 used for HTTP traffic 

Detecting Honeypots

Attackers craft malicious probe packets to scan for services such as HTTP over SSL, SMTP over SSL, and IMAP
Ports that show a particular service running but deny a three-way handshake indicate the presence of a honeypot 

Countermeasures

Shut down switch ports associated with the known attack hosts
Reset (RST) malicious TCP sessions

Cryptography Concepts

The conversion of data into a scrambled code that is decrypted and sent over a private or public network
Used for email messages, chat sessions, web transactions, personal data, corporate data, e-commerce apps, etc.
Types of Cryptography
Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for encryption as it does for decryption
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses different key for  encryption for encryption and decryption
Government Access to Keys (GAK)
Software companies will give copies of all keys
Government promises they will hold on to the keys in a secure will, and will only use them when a court issues a warrant to do so 
Gives them ability to wiretap phones
Encryption Algorithms

Cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption and decryption
Classical Cipher: Most basic type, operates on the alphabet (A-Z)
Modern Ciphers: provide secrecy, integrity, and authentication of sender. Uses a one-way mathematical function capable of factoring large prime numbers
Block Ciphers: Deterministic algorithm operating on block of fixed size with an unvary transofmration specified by a symmetric key. 
Stream Ciphers: Symmetric key ciphers are plaintext digits combined with a key stream (random). 
Data Encryption Standard (DES)
Uses a secret key for both encryption and decryption (symmetric). 62 bit secret key. 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Symmetric key algorithm for securing sensitive but unclassified material by U.S. Government agencies (128 bit)
RC4 variable key size stream cipher
RC5: parameterized algorithm with variable block size, 128 bits
RC6: Symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5
Digital Signature Algorithm(DSA): Specifies algorithm to be used in the generation and verification of digital signatures for sensitive, unclassified application

SHA-3: Uses sponge construction in which message block are XORed

What is SSH (Secure Shell)
Replacement for telnet 
Provides an encrypted channel
Provides strong host-to-host and user authentication

Public Key Infrastructure 

Public Key infrastructure (PKI): set of hardware, software, people, policies, and procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use , store, and revoke digital certificates
Signed CA vs Self Signed: Signed is more trustworthy

Email Encryption

Digital signature used asymmetric cryptography to simulate the security properties of a signature in digital, rather than written form 
A digital signature may be further protection, by encrypting the signed email 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): SSL is an app protocol developed for netscape for managing the security of a message transmission on the internet
It uses RSA asymmetric (public key) encryption
Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protocol to establish a secure connection between a client and a sever. Uses RSA algorithm with 1024 and 2048 bit strengths 



Cryptographic Attacks
Ciphertext only attack: goal of this attack to recover encryption key from cipher text
Adaptive Chosen-plaintext attack: attacker makes a series of interactive queries
Chosen-plaintext attack: attacker defines his own plaintext, feeds it into the cipher, and analyzes the resulting cipher text 
Chosen-plaintext Attack: Attacker defines his own plaintext, feeds it into the cipher, and analyzes the resulting ciphertext
Known-plaintext Attack: Attacker has knowledge of some part of the plain text
Code Breaking Methodologies:
Trickery and Deceit: Social Engineering techniques
Brute Force: trying every possible combination
One-Time pad: contains many non-repeating groups of letters or number keys which are randomly chosen
Frequency Analysis: Study the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext
MITM on digital sig schemes
Attack works by encrypting one end and decrypting from the other end, the meeting in the middle
Can be used for forging signatures even on digital signatures
Side Channel Attack: Physical attack performed on a cryptographic device/cryptosystem to gain sensitive information
