///////////////////////////////
////////Phase 1: Installation/
/////////////////////////////
Built in ESXi 7.0
Provision the VM
  OSSIM v1
    1 logical core
    4GB memory
    25GB storage  // gonna need much more than this if syslog collecting.  my build is now oversaturated from logs
    4 network interfaces
  OSSIM v2
    2 logical cores
    6GB memory
    100GB storage
    4 network interfaces
eth{0,1,2} interfaces on your regular vmnet
eth4 interface on a promiscuous interface
NOTE: you can use 2 interfaces, but will possibly have to rebuild from scratch to add more
Boot into OSSIM iso
Install
Set up networking interface as eth0
eth0 IP = mgmt interface
You only get this initial shot to set up DHCP if you're stupid enough to do so
/////////////////////////////
/////Phase 2: Configuration/
///////////////////////////
move over to a web browser
visit https://<ip>
set up your user
log in
go through the wizard
if you allocated low resources, it'll take a min to actually load up
through the wizard, set up the following:
////network interfaces:
according to att, 
  management = connects to console and web ui
  network monitor = promiscuous interface for monitoring
  log collection and scanning = scanning and log collection interface, if configured.  
                                if not configured, alienvault uses the management interface
when setting up the itnerfaces, you may need to allocate a static IP, just fyi
eth0 = (.150) management
eth1 = (.151) log collection and scanning
eth2 = not in use (reserve this for alternate subents, later
eth3 = (.153) monitoring
////asset discovery
either import via csv, add manually, or perform a network scan
OSSIM handles assets as network objects
network objects can be either individual endpoints, networks, or groups
checkbox your network and click scan
you'll be stuck here until scan is complete
OSSIM will import each discovered endpoint as an object
according to att USM workshops, there's no mass object edit, so be aware of that
the scan will say it found 0 results, just close the pop up
view the scanned assets, edit and categorize them with the TYPE dropdown
basically the rest of the wizard works off of TYPE categorizations
////deploy HIDS
enter whatever Windows DA or LA and Linux SSH common creds
you can't add multiple sets of creds for each
this will push agents
I am unsure if these are ossec agents or what
////log management
connect any network devices
////OTX
go ahead and sign up for an OTX key and input it here
//////////////////////
////catching syslogs/
////////////////////
log into all your stuffs and point their syslogs at eth1's IP
the default OSSIM udp port is, ta-da, 514
//////////////////////////////////////
////scheduling vulnerability scan v1/
////////////////////////////////////
time to construct baselines
go to Environment>Assets>Schedule Scan>Schedule New Scan
name the scan whatever
enter the target networks
change scan type to custom, scan entire port range
change timing to polite, i think this is an nmap T3 speed scan
change frequency to weekly
save
go to Environment>Vulnerabilities>New Scan Job
schedule scan
vulnerability scans
new scan job
pick a name
select profile Deep Non-destructive profile (destructive will actually DOS devices)
schedule it accordingly
add the target network
save
in a moment the scan will begin
in my case, the scan had no results
i unchecked Pre-Scan Locally and unchecked Only Scan Live Hosts
this resolved the issue, scan began
to view results...
save an initial baseline report by...
